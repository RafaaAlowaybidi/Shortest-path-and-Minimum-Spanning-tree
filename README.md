Project Name:
Shortest path and Minimum Spanning tree
prim & kruskal & Boruvka

Programming Language: 
python

Project Idea: 
This project displays three algorihtms with three data structures for each algorithm 
that solve The shortest path problem is the problem of finding a path between two vertices (or nodes) in a graph 
such that the sum of the weights of its constituent edges is minimized form using python language .

IDE to Start the Project:
Spyder IDE Download Link: 
https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/releases/latest/download/Spyder_64bit_full.exe

How to Open  the Project: 
- Open the folder ðŸ“‚"Algorithm_project"
- This folder contain three file and inside there are code file,data file and REPORT for project. 

- The first folder is "AlgoProject" which is contained three algorithm implemented by three data structures (Graph list,Graph Matrix ,priority queue,Red Black tree)
  In the "Graph List" data structures there are some method(viewGraph,nodeHasEdge, hasPath,getNeibors) 
  In the "Graph Matrix" data structures there are some Methods(viewGraph,hasPath,getNeibors,hasEdge)
  In the "priority queue" data structures there are some class(PriorityQueue)
  In the "Red Black tree" data structures 

  
  In the "prim" Algorithm in the "Red Black tree" and taking Adjacency list as input
  In the "kruskal" Algorithm in the "list (array)" and taking Adjacency matrix as input 
  In the "boruvka" Algorithm in the "priority queue" and taking Adjacency matrix as input  

  In the "prim" Algorithm in the "priority queue" and taking Adjacency matrix as input
  In the "kruskal" Algorithm in the "priority queue" and taking Adjacency list as input
  In the "boruvka" Algorithm in the "priority queue" and taking Adjacency list as input 
  
  In the "prim" Algorithm in the "list (array)" and taking Adjacency list as input
  In the "kruskal" Algorithm in the "list (array)" and taking Adjacency list as input 
  In the "boruvka" Algorithm in the "list (array)" and taking Adjacency list as input

 
- The second folder is REPORT for project


- The third folder is data file

NOTE: 
This project to read BIG DATA more than 120 thousand data contain 3 colom and 124675 row.
